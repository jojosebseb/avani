                    AVANI is social enterprise based in Bali, Indonesia, the epicenter of the battle against plastic waste. Established in Bali in 2014 with the vision of returning the island's pristine condition back to what it was in the past. The company embarked on a mission focused on cutting down plastic consumption by offering eco-friendly alternatives for everyday single use conventional plastic products With this focus in mind, the company launched its first product, a biodegradable eco-poncho derived from sustainable resources, as an alternative to vinyl plastic ponchos which have been the status quo material being utilized for many years. The eco-poncho became a hit in the local market place and was used by the company as a positive momentum to diverge itself into the hospitality industry by providing a wider range of ecofriendly products. Still maintaining its focus on combating singleuse conventional plastic product, today AVANI is endowed with a wide portfolio of products which are ready to be utilized in an effort to leave impactful footprints for future generations.

                    Assumed by most as a tropical island paradise with pristine white sand beaches, the truth is that Bali's beaches are now often saturated with garbage and debris, and the majority of this trash is plastic. We aim to help rehabilitate the island by offering sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives to hazardous products that locals and tourists use every day.

                    Bali, Indonesia is assumed by most as a tropical island paradise with pristine white sand beaches. Unfortunately, scrutinizing the matters closer, the truth is that Bali's beaches are now often saturated with garbage and debris with the majority of them being plastic. As of 2015, it is known that Bali produces around 1,000 cubic meters of plastic garbage every day and only .5% of this waste gets recycled or up-cycled.  PT. Nirwana Alam Hijau (under trade name Avani) is a Bali-based social enterprise that supplies ecofriendly products as a replacement to plastic. The company aims to help rehabilitate the island by offering 100% sustainable disposable packaging solutions and compostable plastic alternatives to Bali's hospitality & retail industries. By focusing to replace single-use plastic products,  the company offers:
                    <ul class="dotted-ul">
                        <li>Take-away cups</li>
                        <li>Take-aways boxes</li>
                        <li>Wooden eating cutlery</li>
                        <li>Paper Straws</li>
                        <li>Shopping bags</li>
                        <li>Apparel Poly bags</li>
                        <li>Laundry bags</li>
                        <li>and more</li>
                    </ul>
                    By providing affordable & eco-friendly alternatives along with the cooperation of the local service & retail industries we hope to minimize the amount of toxic plastics consumed and discarded into Bali's critical ecosystem. At the same time, in delivering its values as a social enterprise, Avani is committed to help teach its inhabitants, through their partnership programs, how to maintain it and help return Bali's tarnished image to its past glory.
